# Unifi Protect Dewarp

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

This Home Assistant component is designed to integrate with Unifi Protect and provide dewarped camera feeds specifically for the AI360 camera model. It takes the distorted panoramic feed and processes it to display a more conventional, dewarped view.

## Prerequisites

*   A working installation of Home Assistant.
*   The Unifi Protect integration configured in Home Assistant.
*   A Unifi Protect AI360 camera.

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have HACS installed and configured in Home Assistant.
2.  Add this repository to HACS as a Custom Repository (Integration type).
3.  Install the "Unifi Protect Dewarp" integration via HACS.
4.  Restart Home Assistant.
5.  Add the integration via the Home Assistant UI: Go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services** -> **Add Integration**. Search for "Unifi Protect Dewarp" and follow the setup steps.
6.  Configure the integration as required.

## Configuration

[Please provide details on any configuration options users need to set up the dewarping, such as selecting which AI360 cameras to process, viewing angles, or other parameters. You can edit this section later or provide the details now so I can add them.]

## Usage

Once configured, the component should provide new camera entities or services related to your AI360 cameras, offering the dewarped views.

[Explain how users can access or use the dewarped feeds in their dashboards or automations. Provide examples of picture glance cards, custom cards, or service calls if applicable.]
